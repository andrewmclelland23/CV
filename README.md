## Andrew McLelland

To misquote Liam Neeson, "I have a very peculiar set of skills". I’m an aspiring full stack web developer (currently undertaking a highly regarded 4 month coding bootcamp) with 3 years experience in ETL systems integration development. I play piano, speak french, play tennis, attempt meditation and dabble in Photoshop. My general philosophy is that a broad set of skills and experiences is really important for being happy and effective in work and in life.

### Background

I left University with a joint honours degree in Physics and French; a mind bending mixture of physics, maths and the scientific approach with language, communication, history and literature studies and lots of essay writing. Continuing with this theme of mixed disciplines, I joined the John Lewis IT Leadership Grad Scheme where I was trained for multiple roles within IT: project management, business analysis, operations, testing and development. Discovering that I love solving complex problems and creating things, I became a developer. 

I have experience of working in Waterfall and Agile development methodologies and can offer technical skills with the proven ability to learn new technologies fast. Perhaps my most valuable offering is my conscientiousness; I care about what I create and the projects I’m involved in and as such will do what it takes, drawing on my management, testing and analysis experience, to ensure a high quality delivery. 

## Skills

#### Integration Development - Ab Initio

I’m a certified Ab Initio developer with 3 years experience working on diverse projects across John Lewis IT. I’ve grown quickly in my technical capability as well as my communication and management skills. In my relatively short time within the team I went from having no technical background to senior developer.

#### Solution Design

As my technical ability has grown over the last three years I’ve been able to transition from following the designs of a tech lead to using my analytical ability to perform the solution design on my projects. This culminated in me being given complete control over the design and development of an integration pattern for interacting with Google Cloud from Ab Initio. By using solid security principles and designing my solution to be highly configurable and reusable, I not only delivered value for this project, but opened the door for later projects who were able to easily integrate with Google Cloud using the pattern and code I had created.

#### Management Skills

As I’ve grown as a developer I have progressively taken on more responsibility in the projects I work on. As an experienced Ab Initio developer at John Lewis I’m responsible for the following tasks: systems analysis, solution design, solution development, test environment provision, test data provision, test support, implementation planning, job scheduling and code review for junior devs. To maintain the project lifecycle while juggling so many disparate elements requires excellent management and communication skills. In my final project at John Lewis I took on the role of Tech Lead for a complex Data Warehousing project with challenging deadlines. Keeping the project moving whilst also managing the work of a junior developer was a big step up for me but fortunately it was a challenge I was able to meet. Appraisal results at John Lewis are split into a mark for what you achieved and a mark for how you went about it. My score following this project was ‘Very Good’ & ‘Outstanding’ respectively.
